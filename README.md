Introduction
Golang, also known as Go, is a powerful and efficient programming language developed by Google. I am excited to learn Go due to its simplicity, strong standard library, concurrency support, and excellent performance. This repository serves as a personal learning log and knowledge base for all my Go-related endeavors.

Getting Started
To get started with Go, follow these steps:

Install Go: Visit the official Go website and follow the instructions to download and install the latest version of Go for your operating system.

Set up the Go workspace: Go requires you to organize your projects in a specific workspace structure. Create the workspace directory and set up the necessary environment variables (GOPATH, GOROOT).

Learn the Basics: Start with the basics of Go programming, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and more. I'll be adding my notes and code examples related to these concepts.

Explore the Standard Library: Go has a rich standard library that provides many built-in packages for various tasks. I'll be delving into different packages and their usage.

Build Projects: As I progress, I'll be working on small to complex projects to apply what I've learned and gain practical experience.

Progress
I will keep track of my learning progress and milestones in this section. It will help me gauge my growth as a Golang developer and motivate me to keep pushing forward.

 Basic syntax and data types
 Control structures (if-else, loops, etc.)
 Functions and packages
 Pointers and memory management
 Concurrency and Goroutines
 Error handling
 File I/O
 Web development with Go
 Testing and benchmarking
Projects
This section will contain various Golang projects that I work on. Each project will have its own directory and a brief description of its purpose and features.
